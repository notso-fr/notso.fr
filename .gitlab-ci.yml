  # # When using dind service we need to instruct docker, to talk with the
  # # daemon started inside of the service. The daemon is available with
  # # a network connection instead of the default /var/run/docker.sock socket.
  # #
  # # The 'docker' hostname is the alias of the service container as described at
  # # https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_docker_images.html#accessing-the-services
  # #
  # # Note that if you're using Kubernetes executor, the variable should be set to
  # # tcp://localhost:2375 because of how Kubernetes executor connects services
  # # to the job container
  # DOCKER_HOST: tcp://docker:2375/
  # When using dind, it's wise to use the overlayfs driver for
  # improved performance.
